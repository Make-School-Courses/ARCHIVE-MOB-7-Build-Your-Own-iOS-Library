# UIKit & UIDesign

## Course Overview
The goal of this class will be learning the basics of UIKit, the user interface layer in iOS. We will take a look at the built in UIKit elements to get a better understanding of how they work.

The end product of the class will be a library of UI elements built from scratch.

Class projects will include the creation of a Make School set of UI elements. Students will all contribute to the library using Github. The goal for each student is to provide at least one new and unique UI element to the library. Students will also create their own customized UI elements that can be used in their own projects.


## Objectives & Competencies

1. Learn to use the coordinate system
2. Use events and triggers to handle user interactions
2. Build flexible UI controls using subclasses.
3. Modify and architect UI elements that are flexible using: @IBDesignable and @IBInspectable
4. Understand the view and layer hierarchy.
