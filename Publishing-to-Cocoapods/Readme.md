# Publishing to CocoaPods


CocoaPods has a detailed guide on creating a cocoapod, follow the link and the instructions below to create a cocoapod:

[Creating a CocoaPod](https://guides.cocoapods.org/making/using-pod-lib-create)


To upload our library through CocoaPods, we have to use one of CocoaPod's software - `trunk`. Trunk lets us interface with the CocoaPod API to upload our library. Follow the instructions below
